<title>This is a Title</title>
<head>
<center><big><h1>Welcome to HTML<h1></big>
<br>
<br>
<h1>PART ONE (Basic Tags)</h1>
<h4> Tags are set off with angle brackets ... <, and > the first tag looks like this, <p> and </p> </h4>
</center>
<h1>This is an H1</h1>
<h2>This is an H2</h2>
<h3>This is an H3</h3>
<h4>This is an H4</h4>
<h5>This is an H5</h5>
<h5>This is an H6</h6>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<p> You can use a Br tag to break lines<br> like in the example here!. <br>This is becasue your browser reads the code not spaces so <br>Br can be used to break lines off <br>at the end of the >.
<br>
<p> This is an example of a Strong tag.. <strong> it bolds text</strong>, and un-bolds. </p>
<br>
<center> <p> This is an example of a center tag </p> </center>
<br>
<p> We now come in contact with the UL tag as seen below </p>

<ul>
<p>List 1</p>
<p>List 2</p>
<p>List 3</p>
</ul>

<p> A UL tag lists items, to add a bullet point put it in an LI tag as seen below </p>

<ul>
<li> List 1 with bullet</li>
<li> List 2 with bullet</li>
<li> List 3 with bullet</li>
</head>
<body>
<p> All of the stuff you just learned was put into a head tag, this will be displayed on the top of your page <br> All of this is now in the body tag, the mid section of your website. Notice the indent.</p>

<strong> <p> Your website starts with a !doctype tag followed by a head, then body, and footer tag.<p> <br> </strong>

<center><big><h1>PART TWO (More Tags and Forms)</h1></big></center>

<p> I can not show you every single part of html but I am showing you the basics.. <br>
<br>
Lets look into other tags...<br> a B tag bolds just like a strong tag<br>
a Big tag makes test big IE. <big> BIG </big> <br>
a Small tag makes text small IE. <small> small </small><br>
a S tag strikes through text IE. <s> Strike through </s><br>
</p>

<h4> Making a "Form" </h4>

<p> A form tag make a "form" to start an input, This will start an area to put the input this cannot be shown so the example is "away" from the paragraph text ie. <form>Form Starts Here</form><br>
<br>
An A tag is a link tag, It is all the links on a page (In part 3 we I will show you how to style it.)<br>
It looks like this without the angle brackets.. <br>
a href="http://www.Website.com">Visit Website.com! /a <br>
The herf is how you definen the link, the secound part is what the link will say! IE.<br>
<a href="http://www.pandanetworks.net">Visit PandaNetworks.net!</a><br>
<br>
This is where it gets <b>CONFUSING</b> So pay attention...<br>
The next step is an input tag, without the angle brackets it looks like this<br>
input type="" name="" value=""<br>
the type can be set to a ...	
</p>
<big>
<b>
<ul>
<p>button</p>
<p>checkbox</p>
<p>color</p>
<p>date </p>
<p>datetime </p>
<p>datetime-local </p>
<p>email </p>
<p>file</p>
<p>hidden</p>
<p>image</p>
<p>month </p>
<p>number </p>
<p>password</p>
<p>radio</p>
<p>range </p>
<p>reset</p>
<p>search</p>
<p>submit</p>
<p>tel</p>
<p>text</p>
<p>time </p>
<p>url</p>
<p>week</p>
</ul>
</b>
</big>
<br>
<p> For this I will use a TEXT it looks like this<br>
input type="TEXT" value="" <br>
The value is what is in the solid text in the input tag IE. <br>
input type="TEXT" value="How to HTML"<br>
This is what it looks like<br>
<input type="text" value="How to HTML"><br>
Now all we need is a submit it looks like this again without the angle brakets </p><br>
input type="submit" value="Submit Question" IE.<br>
<br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit"><br>
<p>The entire thing has to be put into the form tag, it looks like this...<br>
</p>
<form>
<input type="text" value="How to HTML"><br>
<input type="submit" value="Submit Question">
</form> 
<p> The last thing we are going to look at for this section is the checkbox or the radio forms..<br>
form<br>
  input type="radio" name="htmlSkill" value="Good" <br>
  input type="radio" name="htmlSkill" value="Still Learning" 
/form<br>
It looks like this </p>
<form>
  <input type="radio" name="htmlSkill" value="Good"> Good <br>
  <input type="radio" name="htmlSkill" value="Still Learning"> Still Learning
</form>

<center><big><h1>PART THREE (Basic CSS (Cascading Style Sheets))</h1></big></center>

<p> Welcome to the CSS portion of my "tutorial"<br>
CSS is used to style a website or animate using "addons" like webkit<br>
You open the tag by calling the html tag and id here is an example<br>
<br>
H1 {<br>
<br>
}<br>
<br>
In between the { } lines is where you put attributes to style html tags a list can be found here<br>http://www.w3schools.com/cssreF/ <br> <br>

Div {<br>
 text-align: center;
 font-family: "Comic Sans MS", cursive, sans-serif;
<br>
}<br>
<br>
Make sure to end each attribute with ;<br>
<h3>Finish this on the W3 school link!</h3.
